# Cloud_MultiClassification_NeuralNetwork
 We trained a neural network on a dataset containing images or sensor readings of various cloud types. By analyzing features such as shape, density, and color, the model classifies clouds into categories (e.g., cumulus, stratus, cirrus), supporting applications like weather forecasting and climate research.
